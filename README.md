# Derivates with the  SymPy function

This program teaches to use the library SymPy to solve complex mathematical problems of infinitesimal calculus. The repository SymPy has to purpose to arrive at a complete computer algebra system and keep it in simple code. 

   Review in your computer the installation python3. If you already have a version of python installed, check it out and but update. To review Version of      the sistem in the console

   >>>python3 --version 

Second step

   Copy in the console

   following

   >>> pip install sympy. 

   After installation, it is best to verify that your freshly-installed SymPy works. To do this, start up Python and import the SymPy libraries:

   >>> from sympy import *

Three step
